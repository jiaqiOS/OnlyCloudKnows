## Description

"In fact, art always attempted to represent the greatest possible power, the power that ruled the world in its totality..."

― Boris Groys, Art Power

_Only Cloud Knows_ is a Chrome extension that performs art recognition on images, as perceived through the lens of Google Cloud Vision AI, manifesting how this emerging regime attempts to capture the incalculable, incomparable, and unknown in computationally legible form—the confidence labels returned from the Vision API overlay the images as each page loads. By navigating within machine intelligence's wrong-headed perceptions, _Only Cloud Knows_ invites users to consider the limits of this data-centric worldview: What lies beneath its threshold of recognizability? What is excluded from future possibilities? With this project, I aim to mirror how faith in the technical sightline has clouded our vision and to uncover how accelerating cognitive automation has surreptitiously short-circuited our sensory-noetic loop.

The ubiquitous cloud-shaped icon on our screens encapsulates an infinitely complex system of networks comprised of servers, routers, fiber-optic cables, data centers, and satellites, encircling the entire planet. This digital and physical infrastructure generates, aggregates, stores, transmits, and processes massive amounts of data, providing a "natural" environment for developing artificial intelligence systems at scale. Machine learning instruments deployed to the cloud enhance their capacities via giant datasets, becoming the engine of improvement in cloud-based technology's overall efficiency and effectiveness. The amalgamation of cloud computing with artificial intelligence is termed "the intelligent cloud," hegemonically controlled by a handful of leading technology corporations, and capable of inscribing more and more aspects of the world into the computational body, based on one implicit assumption: that the world is reducible to data that can be objectively analyzed and perfectly modeled.
